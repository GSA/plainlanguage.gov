    Join the Plain Language Community of Practice for an hour-long conversation about what makes a good plain language infographic – 
    one that anyone can understand.

    We’ll cover:

    * What do you need to consider?
    * What questions do you have to answer as you plan to do one?
    * How do you deal with data?
    * How do you communicate with people who want you to create an infographic?
    * Send us a sample before the meeting, or add the URL of your infographic when you register.
