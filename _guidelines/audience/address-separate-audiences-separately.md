An important part of writing for your audience is addressing separate audiences separately. Many documents and websites address more than one audience. Mixing material intended for different audiences may confuse readers. By addressing different audiences in the same place, you make it harder for each audience to find the material that applies to them. In regulations, this may make it difficult for each audience to comply with your agency's requirements.

## Example

The following example shows a regulation ([40 CFR 745](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=eee3a01b00b523d32454249c3d647132&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr745_main_02.tpl)) that treats each regulated group separately in its own subpart, rather than mixing all the groups together. For an example of a rule that does not address separate groups separately, see [5 CFR 1320](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title05/5cfr1320_main_02.tpl).
