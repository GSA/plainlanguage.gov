title: Make it easy to follow
sidenav: guidelines
---

People read government websites and documents to get answers. They want to know how to do something or what happens if they don't do something—and they want to gain this knowledge quickly. Organize your writing so it's easy to follow along.

Think through the questions your users likely have and then organize the material in a logical order.

For regulations and other complex documents, create a comprehensive table of contents. Your table of contents should be a reliable roadmap that users can follow to quickly find what they need.

## Organizing principles

### Chronological order

Regulations frequently address processes. Chronological order is best for process information:

1. You fill out an application to get a benefit.
2. You submit the application.
3. The agency reviews the application.
4. The agency makes a decision on the application.

Present the steps chronologically, in the order your user and your agency will follow them. The table of contents below is organized in a logical sequence for a grant program.

### General first, exceptions, conditions, and specialized information later

Another useful organizing principle is to put general information first, and specialized information or exceptions later. That way, the material that addresses most readers in most situations comes first. For some documents this will work well along with a chronological organization. In others, it may be the primary organizing principle.

### Limit levels to three or fewer

Crafting documents with four, five, or even more levels makes it difficult for your audience to keep track of where they are in the process. You should address this problem in your initial structuring of the document.

Dividing your document into more pieces at the top levels should allow you to limit subdivisions below the major level to two. The Office of the Federal Register recommends that regulations contain no more than three levels, noting that more than three levels make regulations hard to read and use.
