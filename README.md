**Work in progress!!!**

Website for plainlanguage.gov

### Built using

* The [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov), a set of reusable, high quality components for modern websites. Maintains consistency with the [many other U.S. government websites using the Standards](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/develop/WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md#website-and-applications-that-use-the-standards).

* The U.S. Web Design Standards [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll). A few of the components have been overwritten or customized, but the theme is in use.

### Developing locally

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator.

The application is optimized for deployment on 18F's [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) static site hosting service.

Install dependencies with Bundler:

```
bundle install
```

And run the site with Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If all goes well, visit the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
