# plainlanguage.gov

This is the public repo for [plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov), which is an online resource to help federal employees understand and comply with the Plain Writing Act of 2010. It represents a joint effort by the Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) and the General Services Administration.

## About the site

* This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator. For more information about using Jekyll, refer to the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

* The site is built with the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov), a set of reusable, high-quality components for modern websites. We're using the Web Design Standards [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll) with some customized styles and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/license/) icons.

* The site is optimized for deployment on 18F's [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) publishing service.
