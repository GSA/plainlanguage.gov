Adding [lists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/organize/use-lists.md %}) and [useful headings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings.md %}) is a great way to emphasize important information in your writing.

You can also add **bold** and _italics_ to emphasize important concepts within a particular section. While it is difficult to use visual emphasis in regulations, it helps bring out important information in other writing. Only emphasize important information, otherwise you'll dilute its impact.

PUTTING EVERYTHING IN CAPITAL LETTERS IS NOT A GOOD EMPHASIS TECHNIQUE. ALTHOUGH IT MAY DRAW THE USER'S ATTENTION TO THE SECTION, IT MAKES IT HARDER TO READ. AND ONLINE, IT'S CONSIDERED SHOUTING.

<u>Similarly, underlining will draw the user's attention to the section, but it makes it hard to read.</u>

Besides, when reading online, people expect underlined text to be a link. It's better to use **bold** and _italics_ for important issues.
