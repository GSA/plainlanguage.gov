At our bootcamps, we train volunteer federal employees how to conduct plain-language classes for government agencies. Please sign up if you:

- are a federal employee
- are enthusiastic about plain language
- have already attended a PLAIN half-day class
- have supervisor approval to teach 1–2 classes a year for PLAIN at an agency other than your own

We offer these bootcamps 3–4 times a year. We'll announce the dates on our mailing list once they're set.

We can train 30 people per class. Registration is done on a first-come, first-served basis. You must be a federal employee (not a contractor) and have a .gov or .mil email address to register. We don't maintain a waitlist. If you did not attend a bootcamp in previous years, you must register again.
