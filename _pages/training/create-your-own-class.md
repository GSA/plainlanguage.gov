PLAIN offers a variety of introductory classes on plain language. You may use these materials as the basis of your own class.

## Half-day presentations

- [Principles of Plain Language]({{ 'media/training/PLAIN_Principles.pptx' | relative_url }}) (PPTX), our original plain-language class
- [Plain Language and Writing for the Web]({{ 'media/training/plainlanguage_and_webwriting.pptx' | relative_url }}) (PPTX), based on Principles, but with a web focus
- [Incorporating Plain Language into Websites]({{ 'media/training/plainlanguage_and_websites.ppt' | relative_url }}) (PPT), a more theoretical class looking at principles of good web design (which includes plain language, of course)

## Exercises and handouts

We use the same set of exercises for each of these classes, but add an extra page for the web-centric classes:

- [Hands-on exercises]({{ 'media/training/exercises_all_writing_classes.pdf' | relative_url }}) (PDF)
- [Addition for web classes]({{ 'media/training/addendum_web_classes.pdf' | relative_url }}) (PDF)

We also have a slightly different [set of exercises]({{ 'media/training/exercises.doc' | relative_url }}) and [answers]({{ 'media/training/exerciseanswers.doc' | relative_url }}) (DOC) that you can use with our slides.

Here's a generic [class evaluation form]({{ 'media/training/class_evaluation_form.pdf' | relative_url }}) (PDF).

## Other presentations

These presentations last between 30 and 60 minutes. They are brief overviews about plain language but don't offer any in-depth instruction on how to communicate plainly. The first 2 are targeted toward managers. The third is targeted toward anyone creating or redesigning a website.

- [The Plain Writing Act of 2010]({{ 'media/training/forManagers_theAct_training.pptx' | relative_url }}) (PPTX) and the importance of creating a plain-language training program

- [Why Plain Language is Important]({{ 'media/training/forManagers_whyPL_benefits.ppt' | relative_url }}) (PPT) and the benefits of communicating in plain language

- [Plain Language, Usability, and Information Architecture]({{ 'media/training/Overview-pl_usability_ia.pptx' | relative_url }}) (PPTX)
