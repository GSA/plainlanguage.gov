We asked the top government plain language regulatory experts to analyze some existing plain language regulations. We hope this will help you develop even better plain language documents.

To see any of these regulations:

1. Go to [ecfr.gov](https://www.ecfr.gov/).

2. In the drop-down menu, select the title number (the first two digits in the regulation's title) and click **Go**.

3. Click on the link that includes the regulation number you are interested in.

4. On the resulting page, scroll down to the regulation. Note that on that page, if you click on the left-most column you will be taken to the entire regulation, including a table of contents. If you click on the second column, you will be taken to individual sections, one at a time.

--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

## Key to terms used in tables

### Well organized

Organized to meet the reader's needs. An overview of the requirements or process comes first, followed by the details. If there is a process involved, the regulation gives the outlines first in a list or table, followed by details in separate sections.

### Short sections

There are about five or six sections per page of CFR text.

### Minimizes subdivisions

No section goes below the "(A)" level, unless the material is presented as a table.

### Uses lists

Wherever possible, the rule uses lists rather than text to present information.

### Uses tables

Complex information is in the form of a table wherever possible.

### Short sentences

While sentences vary in length, no sentence is over 40 words long.

### Sentences start with main idea

Exceptions or qualifications are at the end of the sentence or in another sentence.

### Active voice

The rule tells readers clearly who does what and does not use passive voice.

### Uses "must" for requirements

The word "shall" doesn't appear in the rule.

### Clear language

Rule avoids jargon and legalese.

### Uses pronouns

Addresses the reader as "you" and the agency as "we" for greater impact and clarity.
