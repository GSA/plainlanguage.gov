(Excerpt, see CFR for the complete text.)

### Sec. 250.106 What standards will the Director use to regulate lease operations?

The Director will regulate all operations under a lease, right-of-use and easement, or right-of-way to:

(a) Promote orderly exploration, development, and production of mineral resources;

(b) Prevent injury or loss of life;

(c) Prevent damage to or waste of any natural resource, property, or the environment; and

(d) Cooperate and consult with affected States, local governments, other interested parties, and relevant Federal agencies.

### Sec. 250.107 What must I do to protect health, safety, property, and the environment?

(a) You must protect health, safety, property, and the environment by:

  (1) Performing all operations in a safe and workmanlike manner; and

  (2) Maintaining all equipment in a safe condition.

(b) You must immediately control, remove, or otherwise correct any hazardous oil and gas accumulation or other health, safety, or fire hazard.

(c) You must use the best available and safest technology (BAST) whenever practical on all exploration, development, and production operations. In general, we consider your compliance with MMS regulations to be the use of BAST.

(d) The Director may require additional measures to ensure the use of BAST:

  (1) To avoid the failure of equipment that would have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment;

  (2) If it is economically feasible; and

  (3) If the benefits outweigh the costs.

### Sec. 250.108 What requirements must I follow for cranes and other material-handling equipment?

(a) All cranes installed on fixed platforms must be operated in accordance with American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice for Operation and Maintenance of Offshore Cranes (API RP 2D), incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198.

(b) All cranes installed on fixed platforms must be equipped with a functional anti-two block device by March 16, 2005.

(c) If a fixed platform is installed after March 17, 2003, all cranes on the platform must meet the requirements of the American Petroleum Institute's Specification for Offshore Cranes (API Spec 2C), incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198.

(d) All cranes manufactured after March 17, 2003, and installed on a fixed platform, must meet the requirements of API Spec 2C, incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198.

(e) You must maintain records specific to a crane or the operation of a crane installed on an OCS fixed platform, as follows:

  (1) Retain all design and construction records, including installation records for any anti-two block safety devices, for the life of the crane. The records must be kept at the OCS fixed platform.

  (2) Retain all inspection, testing, and maintenance records of cranes for at least 4 years. The records must be kept at the OCS fixed platform.

  (3) Retain the qualification records of the crane operator and all rigger personnel for at least 4 years. The records must be kept at the OCS fixed platform.

(f) You must operate and maintain all other material-handling equipment in a manner that ensures safe operations and prevents pollution.
