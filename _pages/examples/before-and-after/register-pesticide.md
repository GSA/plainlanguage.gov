* #### Before

  The process of registering a pesticide begins with submission to EPA of an application package. EPA's review of this application includes assessment of the hazards to human health and the environment that may be posed by the pesticide. Depending on the class of pesticide and the priority assigned to it, the review process can take several years.

* #### After

  To register a pesticide, send EPA an application package. We will assess whether the pesticide poses hazards to human health and the environment. Depending on the pesticide and the priority we assign to it, our review can take several years.
