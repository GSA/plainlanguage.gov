_This example was created for training and is not official agency text._

* #### Before

  Emphasis was placed on near shore waters, coastal wetlands, land by the lakes, the impact of changing land use, and information availability and management. For each conference an integration paper was prepared for participants, bringing all the topics together. Also for both conferences indicators were chosen and, based on expert opinions, subjective assessments were provided as to conditions in terms of good, fair, poor, etc.
