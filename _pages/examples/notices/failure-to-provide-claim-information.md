* #### Before

  Dear addressee,

  This letter concerns your recent claim for Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.

  Before final action could be taken on your claim, we needed (Evidence). This evidence was requested in our letter dated (Date). Our records do not show we have received this evidence, therefore, we have disallowed your claim.

  This disallowance does not mean that you cannot submit the requested evidence. You can do so at any time. However, if the evidence is not received before (Date), which is one year from the date of our first letter, benefits, if entitlement is established, cannot be paid before the date of receipt of the evidence.

  If you disagree with this disallowance and believe the evidence now of record is sufficient for us to award you benefits, please refer to the enclosed VA Form 1-4107, Notice of Procedural and Appellate Rights, which explains your rights to appeal.

  Sincerely yours,

  Enclosure:<br>
  VAF 1-4107
