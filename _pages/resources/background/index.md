Plain language (also called plain writing or plain English) is communication your audience can understand the first time they read or hear it.

The [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html) defines plain language as:

> Writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience.

Language that is plain to one set of readers may not be plain to others. Written material is in plain language if your audience can:

- Find what they need
- Understand what they find
- Use what they find to meet their needs

There are many techniques that can help you achieve this goal. Among the most common are:

- Logical organization with the reader in mind
- "You" and other pronouns
- Active voice
- Short sentences
- Common, everyday words
- Easy-to-read design features
