RESOLVED, That the American Bar Association urges agencies to use plain language in writing regulations, as a means of promoting the understanding of legal obligations, using such techniques as:

- Organizing them for the convenience of their readers;
- Using direct and easily understood language;
- Writing in short sentences, in the active voice; and
- Using helpful stylistic devices, such as question-and-answer formats, vertical lists, spacing that facilitates clarity, and
- tables.

To avoid problems in the use of plain language techniques, agencies should:

- Take into account possible judicial interpretations as well as user understanding;
- Clearly state the obligations and rights of persons affected, as well as those of the agency; and
- Identify and explain all intended changes when revising regulations.
