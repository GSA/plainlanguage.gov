The revised publication _Assuring Access to Essential Health Care_ replaces _Profile 1996_. The name alone is a significant improvement for readers, and makes it more likely they will read it. The rewritten publication eliminates irrelevant information, but includes illustrations and pictures of professionals and services.

## Assuring access to essential health care

### Before

Title I of the CARE Act creates a program of formula and supplemental competitive grants to help metropolitan areas with 2,000 or more reported AIDS cases meet emergency care needs of low-income HIV patients. Title II of the Ryan White Act provides formula grants to States and territories for operation of HIV service consortia in the localities most affected by the epidemic, provision of home and community-based care, continuation of insurance coverage for persons with HIV infection, and treatments that prolong life and prevent serious deterioration of health. Up to 10 percent of the funds for this program can be used to support Special Projects of National Significance.

### After

Low income people living with HIV/AIDS gain, literally, years, through the advanced drug treatments and ongoing care supported by HRSA's Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.
