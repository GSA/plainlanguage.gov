## Plain Writing Act of 2010

[The Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html) promotes clear government communication that the public can understand and use. The Office of Management and Budget issued [final guidance to implement the law on April 13, 2011](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/19/putting-it-plainly).

At [Agency Name], we are committed to writing in plain language and using the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/):

- Our plain writing plan
- [Our compliance report]({{ '/media/agency_compliance_report_template.doc' | relative_url }}) (.DOC template)

We have assigned staff to oversee our plain language efforts:

- [Name], Plain Language Contact
- [Name], Plain Language Coordinator
- [Name], Plain Language Coordinator

We train our employees and have [created or strengthened] our oversight process. We must use plain language in any document that:

- is necessary for obtaining any federal government benefit or service or filing taxes
- provides information about any federal government benefit or service
- explains to the public how to comply with a requirement that the federal government administers or enforces
