Regulations tell Americans how to get benefits, how to meet safety standards, and how to pay their taxes. There are now over 200,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Regulations that are unclear or unreadable make work for the reader and for the agency that issues them. Writing our regulations in a clear and easily readable style would result in a tremendous savings of time and effort for the federal government and for citizens affected by them.

Regulations don't have to be written in "legalese." Don't let anyone convince you that outmoded forms of language are needed in regulations. Plain language works for regulations just as it does for other important forms of written communication.

Yes, Virginia, [plain language regulations]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/regulations/) do exist. In fact, President Clinton issued two separate Executive Orders emphasizing the need for plain language (neither of which has been rescinded). [E.O. 12866](https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12866.pdf) says that regulations must be "simple and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing uncertainty and litigation" (Sec. 1, Par. (b)(12)) and [E.O. 12988](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-02-07/pdf/96-2755.pdf) says that each regulation must specify its effect "in clear language" (Sec. 3 Par. (b)(2)).

On January 18, 2011, President Obama issued [E.O. 13563 — Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/18/executive-order-13563-improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review). It states that our regulatory system must ensure that regulations are accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand.
